/*! \page base_lib_intro Introduction

\section purpose_sec Purpose 

The library provides tools and workflows as well as best practices to create
games using the Unity 3D Game-Engine. It will also provide a generic way to create games. 

\section install_sec Installation and Usage
To use the library simply copy the path "packages/" to your Unity3D project. 
To Get started see \ref getting_started
Version of the lib can be looked up here: UnityGameBaseVersionMenu.cs

\section step1 Step 1: Create a Unity Project
 
Create a Unity project at a location you wish to use. Don't choose any additional packages from your library. 
Once you are done, you should have a project completely void of scripts, textures, models or any other asset. 

Before you proceed make sure to switch the empty project to the meta-files format. To do that, chooose "Edit => Project Settings => Editor". In the "Version Control" section, choose "Meta files" as the mode for your project. 
And finally in the "Asset Serialization" section you should switch the mode to "Force Text". 

\section step2 Step 2: Adding the library to your project

To get the library, you will have to checkout the latest version from the subversion server. Please ask a colleque where to find it. The lib uses tags to track the "released" versions. 
Simply choose the tag which represents the highest version number. 

In the lib you will find a unity project, which represents the library and a folder containing this documentation. 

Copy all files and folders beneath "Assets" to your newly created project. 

Once the library is installed within your project and unity recompiled the source code, you should see a "UGB"-Menu Item appear. 
Beneath it you will find several settings options and tools. It also displays the version of the base lib in your project. 

\section step3 Step 3: Create your default scene

The game library relies heavily on the Game singleton class. The usual project startup layout is as follows. 
You have a default scene, which resides in scenes/default.unity. It only contains one GameObject which is called something like "_Game" or "_Root". 
It has one component of type Game. 

The Game component provides access to all other main game components such as localization, input, game state and more. 
There are three important settings you should consider setting. The first is the Testing flag. 

This flag allows you to set this instance of the Game component to be a testing instance. 
You can read this setting at runtime and prevent scene changes or other state changes. The "_Game" object should be able to reside in every scene of your project and thus provide instant testability to level designers and artists. 

The last setting is the version number. It is used to version save game entries. Once a version entry with a lower version number than your game is loaded, you will get a callback and thus be able to upgrade the data within the save game entry. 

\section step4 Step 4: Setup your game

Create a folder named "scripts". You will put all your CS-files in this folder. 

Add a class to the Folder. It will be your main game logic class. It is usually called "GameLogic". 
It needs to derive from GameLogicImplementationBase and implement the abstract members of this class. 

To actually use the implementation add the GameLogicImplementationAttribute to the class.
